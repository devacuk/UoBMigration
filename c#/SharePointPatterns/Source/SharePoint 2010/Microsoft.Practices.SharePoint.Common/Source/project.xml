        <para>
          The <see cref="N:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common"/> namespace provides general utility classes for simplifying coding
          with SharePoint.  Sub namespaces provide support for specific areas of application configuration management, service location, and logging.

      <summary>
        <para>
          The <see cref="N:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.Configuration"/> namespace contains classes used in managing configuration
          within SharePoint for applications.  The configuration manager supports managing configuration at different levels, like the web, site,
          web application, and farm.  The default implementation uses property bags associated with these objects at these levels like SPWeb, SPWebApplication,
          and SPFarm to store the configuration.  The configuration can be used within the sandbox.

            <description>
              <see cref="T:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.Configuration.IHierarchicalConfig"/> The implementation provides for hierarchical lookup of a configured item. This interface
              looks in order for the property bags.  The order of the hierarchy is web->site->web application->farm.  Not all property bags are available on all contexts.  For example,
              the web application and farm are not available in the sandbox.

            <description>
              <see cref="T:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.Configuration.ConfigManager"/> The implementation provides for accessing configuration settings at
              a specific level, and for setting, updating, and deleting a configuration setting from a specific property bag.
            </description>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>
          The default implementation of property bags can be overridden to provide storage in different backing stores like
          lists as well.  <see cref="T:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.Configuration.IPropertyBagHierarchy"/> for more information.

    <member name="N:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.ListRepository">
      <summary>
        The <see cref="N:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.ListRepository"/> contains components that can be composed to build a repository for a list.  A repository
        provides a means to manage strongly typed entities that are mapped to list items.  The components provided help build simple CAML queries, and to map
        between list items and strongly typed entities.

    <member name="N:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.Logging">
      <summary>
        The <see cref="N:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.Logging"/> namespace can implementation of a logger for logging to the ULS and event log.  This logger
        builds upon the SPDiagnosticsServiceBase provided by SharePoint, and reads categories and areas defined in configuration to use for logging.  Logging can not
        be used within the sandbox without customization since the base SharePoint class does not support sandbox operation.  A full trust sandbox proxy is provided
        that enables logging from the sandbox when installed.  If logging occurs within the sandbox and the proxy is not installed then the logging framework will
        drop the logged or traced message.  These methods are virtual and can be overridden to provide a custom implementation that stores the message to a different 
        source, for example, a list in a sandbox solution.

    <member name="N:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.ServiceLocation">
      <summary>
        The <see cref="N:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.ServiceLocation"/> namespace contains an implementation of a service locator for operation within
        SharePoint, and implements the interface provided by the common service locator project, <see cref="N:IServiceLocator"/>.  The SharePointServiceLocator provides
        bootstrapping of the service locator within the SharePoint environment.  The implementation supports storing type mappings at either the site or farm levels. 
        The site service locators combine the settings from farm and site, with site settings taking precedence over farm settings.  Service location works within the
        sandbox, and will use farm level settings in the sandbox if the proxy is installed for reading farm level configuration.

    <member name="N:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.ProxyArgs">
      <summary>
        The <see cref="N:Microsoft.Practices.SharePoint.Common.ProxyArgs"/> namespace contains the classes used for passing arguments to the full trust proxy operations supported
        by the SharePoint library for use within the sandbox.  These operations include reading web application and farm configuration, logging to the event log and
        ULS, and determining if a specific full trust proxy is installed in the farm.
